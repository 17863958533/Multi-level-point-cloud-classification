Description of development environment:
1. Please configure visual studio 2017 version.
2. Please configure PCL library version 1.9.1 and ensure that the environment configuration is correct.
3. Please use the cmake file in the root directory to compile and generate.
4. When running, each CPP suffix file becomes a unit separately. Please ensure that the name of the main function is unique.
5. Modify the name of the main function to determine which file to execute. We think this method is simple and convenient.
6. The results compiled by my local software are recorded in the folder build. You can use the visual studio 2017 software with your PCL environment configured to open it SLN suffix file to view the project.
7. Upload the software and source code we use for the visualization of point cloud results in the folder viewer.
8. If you have any questions, please contact us by email.
